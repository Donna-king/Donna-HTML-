        Know me!
        <p>
            I’ve always been intrigued with maths! It began with a problem like why Why 0!=1 ...??
            , or how everything is represented
            by a binary electrical signal that registers in one of two states: on or off in computers, and how they have been used!
            Furthermore, why we need mega computers to estimate Pi! 
            I am Donna, big fan of numbers, Big Bang theory and Darwinism (a theory of biological evolution).
            At school, 13-14, I've been working as an IT assistant, math and physics TA.
            I've been always seeking for an oprtunaty to dive into programming, coding; and I found "Code Nation" a fancy place to 
            see myself in kind of real work/study simulated environment.

        What makes a digital project run successfully?
        <p>
            Digital project management is about getting things done in a digital world.
If you want to complete any project successfully, you  need a continual back and forth between team members. They need close collaboration and cooperation.
When it comes to digital projects;
You should  not just be based on user needs.
Do  research for appropriateness.
Be flexible. 
 
Have a wish list of functionality that leads to over engineered solutions.
Consider time consuming to produce. This slows down the delivery of the project.
Make sure there is no confusion over roles. People become defensive when they feel their toes are being trodden on, so  take the time to define roles upfront.
Managing a project need skills such as:
Communication skills
Reliable resource and team leader
Distributing tasks to team members
Setting deadlines
Strategically responding to changes and unexpected challenges
Updating executives and stakeholders with reports
Ensuring the quality of a product
Using data to track project success

        Risk management!

        <p>

            when teams put technology ahead of strategy, before considering the business process implications of the new technology, then errors occur.
            When you don’t define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it affects  the company’s business strategy before moving forward. Also if your digital project plans are not flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.
            Expecting perfection: “done is better than perfect”.
            <br>
            Governance risk relates to board and management performance
            Strategic risks result from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.
            Operational risk and process problems such as procurement, production, and distribution.
            Market risks include competition, foreign exchange, commodity markets, interest rate risk, and credit risks.
            Legal risks, including contract risks and litigation brought against the organization.
            Risks associated with nature hazards,such as storms, floods, and earthquakes; and more over; terrorism and civil unrest.

        <p>
            All these chosen technologies from Trello, Slack to monday.com and more make things easy for you to keep track of collaborative and personal projects - all files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc. It’s important that each file has a history which makes it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different time points.

        </br>
        <br>
        On the other hand you can review other people’s, add comments to or the overall document, and suggest changes, for  collaborative projects, assign tasks to different users to make it clear who is responsible for which part of the analysis.
    </br>
    <br>
    You can also ask certain users to review your code. For personal projects, version control allows you to keep track of your work and easily navigate among the many versions of the files you create, whilst also maintaining an online backup.
</br>
To racap; commitment, pulling and pushing are pretty big achievements of validated technologies.

        GDPR impact…

        <p>
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), came out May 25th 2018,  it’s a new legislation  coming out of the European Union. Although the law focuses on how you protect individuals personal data; it really is a brilliant piece of legislation that is much higher than protection is companies. 
        <br>
        It really gives legislative guidance to organizations about how to manage and governorate their data that they collect. Knowing what you collect, and how you use it or the right things with it, that’s what this law is.

        It really gives legislative guidance to organizations about how to manage and governorate their data that they collect. Knowing what you collect, and how you use it or the right things with it, that’s what this law is.
    </br>
    <br>
    The aim is simple, is to put personal data back in control of individuals, power to the people. The secondary purpose is, gives certainties to companies to comply with data protection laws in the EU, so they only have to comply with a set of privacy rolls.
</br>
<br>
But what is the GDPR?
</br>
It reinforces the European’s Notion that privacy is a fundamental human right and by doing that, it creates new rights for individuals.
</br>
<br>
So how does it impact companies?
</br>
<br>
First of all, it extends far beyond the EU’s borders. If a company offers its services to an EU resident, a law applies, so in essence, pretty much everyone. The second thing is that the risk of non compliance with the law is really high. Companies who think that what’s the risk for me not comply or being in the hurt not getting head of this thing and taking this seriously; enforcements are going to be rebus and is going to be serious and then going to be out of the gates and penalties for non-companies depending on a transgration can be as high as up to 4% a companies global gross revenue or up to €20 million which are huge numbers.
</br>
<br>
What is the law all about?
</br>
<br>
It really is requiring companies due to two things;
</br>
<br>
To be respectful and look at the world at all of the practices.
</br>
<br>
Get a full picture of comprehensive  understanding of what they collect and how they use it, and how these little bits of data flow through the organizations.

        Bugs and Faults!

        <p>
            Before you start looking at the individual web accessibility guidelines, we recommend educating yourself and
            your staff on how individuals with disabilities access the internet and the hurdles they often face. This
            will help you understand why the guidelines are written as they are and can also be very useful in helping
            you establish your web accessibility process. Let's start with accessibility issues that users with visual
            impairments face, which are issues with:

            Layout
            Headings
            Navigation
            Non-HTML content
            JavaScript
            Missing or inaccurate alt text
            Bad form structure
            Those with visual impairments use screen readers to access the internet. A screen reader is a type of
            software which works with the operating system to provide information about icons, menus, files, folders,
            and dialogue boxes. Since screen readers don’t rely on a mouse, they generally operate by responding to
            various keyboard commands. For example, a command may allow a reader to navigate a web page, to read part of
            a document, or make a selection. All operating systems now come with screen readers. There are also some
            commercial screen readers, such as the popular JAWS software.

        The appropriate file types for websites.

        <p>
            All images are made up from either raster or vector file types. Raster images are built through a series of
            pixels, whereas vector files are built using proportional formulas. Every photograph you see on any website
            will be a raster image and will be saved as either a JPEG, PNG or GIF. Vector images, on the other hand, are
            more complex and are typically saved as an SVG. They differ from raster images as they are not known to work
            well with photographs, instead they are perfect for graphics that require frequent resizing such as logos.

            JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when
            saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative
            effect on pagespeed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as a 8MB image as its
            smaller size means it requires less resources to load.
